      "name": "JOHN TALABOT",
      "bio": "<p><strong>John Talabot</strong> occupies a fairly unique position in the current electronic landscape. A space he has carved himself by staying true to an artistic vision that is broad in its scope and specific in its convictions. His open-minded approach to making, collecting and playing music allows him to be just as comfortable on the main stage of a great summer festival as in a small local club, earning the following of both the occasional fan and the demanding connoisseur along the way.</p><p>Today, he keeps pushing the envelope, following instincts rather than stratagems. To do so he favors a continuous dialogue with like-minded artists. His alliance with <strong>Axel Boman</strong> in <strong>Talaboman</strong> has just birthed a new label and his <strong>Lost Scripts</strong> duo with <strong>Pional</strong> keeps delivering sparkles of brilliance, but those are just two of the several joint projects he currently has in play. Some might be announced soon, some might never see the light of day, but most important: they keep ideas flowing. A need for discovery that also defines his tireless search of music, making him one of those rare DJs that can effortlessly juxtapose efficacy, risk, and revelation. His allnighter sets are hard to forget, with notable examples in venues and festivals such as <strong>Sónar</strong>, <strong>Pickle Factory</strong>, <strong>Moog</strong> or the <strong>Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum</strong> in Glasgow. Moreover playing music, his curational endeavors keep expanding, having commissioned stages in festivals such as <strong>Primavera Sound</strong> or <strong>Nuits Sonores</strong> or bringing his <strong>Hivern Discs</strong> label’s nights to clubs around Europe.</p><p>In many ways, his work with the label epitomizes his understanding of music: rigorous and committed, but constantly dynamic and open to the unexpected. Because if <strong>John Talabot</strong> has made something clear over the last decade, is that growth always comes from the will to keep exploring.</p>"

Weightless demonstrated her visceral approach to avant-garde composition which she underscored by developing a live set titled STEAM alongside visual artist <strong>Theresa Baumgartner</strong> in 2018.</p><p>Ever since the LP's release on the revered experimental label iDEAL, she's made regular appearances at clubs like Berghain, Amsterdam's De School and Bassiani in Tbilisi and performed at festivals like MUTEK Montreal, Sónar and Primavera.

    "text2": "RIT/MO is undoubtedly something unusual within the national and international panorama of electronic music festivals. There are many characteristics that make it different, but among them the most notable are that it is a festival with a very small capacity, and that it is celebrated in the middle of nature. Although it presents the festival format, organizing its musical offering over two days and having two stages, the truth is that it has nothing to do with macro festivals. You dance with enough space, there are no hated lines to enter, order at the bar, bathrooms, etc., and the venue has the magic of being located in the foothills of Sierra Elvira (Atarfe, Granada) in an environment where dancing becomes special.",
