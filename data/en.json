    "text": "The premier Spanish electronic music festival ",
    "text2": "RIT/MO is undoubtedly something unusual within the national and international panorama of electronic music festivals. There are many characteristics that make it different, but among them the most notable are that it is a festival with a very small capacity, and that it is celebrated in the middle of nature. Although it presents the festival format, organizing its musical offering over two days and having two stages, the truth is that it has nothing to do with macro festivals. You dance with enough space, there are no hated lines to enter, order at the bar, bathrooms, etc., and the venue has the magic of being located in the foothills of Sierra Elvira (Atarfe, Granada) in an environment where dancing becomes special.",
    "text3": "Although RIT/MO is an event with a reduced capacity, this does not mean that it does not bet on a lineup with top-level artists (and without this implying prohibitive subscription prices!!).",

The closest town is <strong>Atarfe, 8 minutes by car</strong>. If you choose this option, the price of the one-way taxi is around €10 one way. We recommend arranging the return trip with a 24-hour taxi service (the price of the taxi on the return increases to around €15 or €18 as you have to call it to come to the premises to pick up users).",
      "note": "If you call the taxi at the end of each day of the festival, you will have to wait due to the high demand at those times. There is no taxi or Uber stop on the festival grounds, so the return trip by taxi must be made by calling one of the available taxi services."

The bus drops you off in the center of the city for only 3 euros. The bus stop is right at the exit of the arrivals terminal, you can't miss it since the airport is small, and the ticket is bought from the driver without having to reserve it in advance. The company organizes the schedules depending on the arrivals and departures of the flights. Today the bus schedules that go from the airport to the center of Granada operate from 6 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., and in the opposite direction from 5 a.m. to 9:45 p.m."
